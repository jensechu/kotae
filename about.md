# {% ruby ["答", "こた"] %}え // kotae // answer.

Hi I'm [Jensen](https://twitter.com/jensechu),

Since I am horribly unorganized I ended up with ten different notebooks with
incredibly random snippets of Japanese notes from class and personal study.

kotae is a centralized source for my notes as I continue to learn. It's main
use is a reference while reading Japanese material, not to provide full lessons.

If you want more in-depth grammar lessons [check out this site](http://www.guidetojapanese.org/learn/grammar).
